# Watch Us Build

*We changed the name of this series to "Watch Us Build," so you may see an occasional reference to its former name ("Soup to Bits") in this repository.*

This is the app built in the [Watch Us Build episode](https://www.codeschool.com/screencasts/build-an-express-js-app-with-tdd) for the [Building Blocks of Express course](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/building-blocks-of-express-js).

## Running

Install redis. Run `npm install` and `npm start`.

## Tests

To run tests, run `npm test`. These also depend on a redis server up and running.
